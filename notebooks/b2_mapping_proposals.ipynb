    "    b. Keller CDP: ~ 50% covered\n",
    "    c. Altoona\n",
    "    d. Rosburg\n",
    "    e. Grays River\n",
    "    f. Skamokawa Valley etc\n",
    "    _For each PC, identify the % not covered_\n",
    "1. Are there population centers that are completely covered by b2_tiles? --> Yes, highly potential candidates for B2 mapping\n",
    "2. For each popluation center, how many overture_buildings are in them?\n",
    "3. What is the intersection of areas where ovt_bld_count > 400, and population centers?\n",
    "4. In each of the tiles identified in b2_tiles_coverage, what is the population of the tiles?\n",
    "5. In each of the population centers, what is the population?\n",
    "6. What is the population percentage we already coverd in B1 using the ORNL data?"
